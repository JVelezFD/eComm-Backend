 ##Usage
  Here is the video link of the demo : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V8V43FPY1LJQvBrNysOFq_Ijh8ngQ5Yi/view
  After the necessary dependencies have been generated, open a new terminal and cd into the program directory. Run "npm run   seed" to seed the databases with data, then "npm start" to initialize the application.

  Afterwards you can issue mysql commands through the terminal (after running "mysql -u root -p") or use postman, insomnia,   or a similar app to issue Get, Post, Put, or Delete commands.
